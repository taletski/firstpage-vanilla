Main gallery navigation circles: switch cursor to pointer on hover;
Make the main logos clickable links;
Disable text selection in the 'Our Clients' slider controls;

Add transition animation to the 'LATEST WORKS' gallery scrolling;
Use CSS 'white-space: pre' to preserve formatting of the 'Contact us' subsection;

Make the navigation dropdown submenus active upon hover;
Use transition-duration property to make transitions smoother;
Create the gallery;

Include dropdown icon;
Create svg sprites; 
Find icons;
Menu active element design
Get rid of the head__content block;
Understand why menu items do not react to the vertical-align
Float the menu-box to the right;
Find out how the font-size is related to the height of the element in pixels; 
And/or try to avoid binding to the font size; 

#Do later:

Use :focus-within to make the dropdown submenu accessible with keyboard;
Fix: html shows all of the images in the gallery for a moment before the .css styles are applied.

# Notes

If fill property is applied to the svg sprite one can not apply styles to the svg with the css. The good way to go is to apply all styles to icons in the css and never in the svg files.
